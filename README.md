LIBestimote

The Innovative Library
=====================

Created a library system using Estimote Beacon technology and Android Studio as a submission at Hack Western 2.

By integrating the beacons into libraries, we can better allow the users of the libraries to access and navigate the libraries with ease and convenience.
